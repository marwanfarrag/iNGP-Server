# Project Overview
This Google Colab project allows you to generate a 3D model from a series of videos or pictures using COLMAP and Instant Neural Graphics Primitives. The process involves the following steps:

1. Uploading your videos or pictures.
2. Using COLMAP to perform structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo to create a 3D point cloud.
3. Passing the resulting transformation files and images to Instant Neural Graphics Primitives.
4. Generating a 3D model in approximately 2 minutes.

# Features

1. User-Friendly Interface: Easy to upload and process your media files.
2. Fast Processing: Generate high-quality 3D models in a short amount of time (2 minutes max).
3. Automated Workflow: Minimal user intervention required, making it accessible for users with varying technical expertise.

# Usage Instructions

1. Open Google Colab: Click on the project link to open Google Colab.
2. Upload Your Media Files(into ```resources```): Use the file upload interface in Google Colab to upload your videos or pictures.
3. Let it do all the work ;) .
